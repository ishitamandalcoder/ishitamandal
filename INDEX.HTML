            NONVIOLENCE
        </H1>
        <P>
           Nonviolence is a powerful principle that teaches us to solve problems without hurting others. It encourages peace, kindness,
            and understanding in our thoughts, words, and actions. Great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi used nonviolence to fight injustice 
            and bring about social change. By choosing nonviolence, people learn to respect each other, avoid conflict, and create a more 
            harmonious society. In today’s world, nonviolence is important because it helps us build unity and resolve disagreements peacefully.
